    "On Shopify, we have exactly 100 sneaker shops, and each of these shops sells only one model of shoe. We want to do some analysis of the average order value (AOV). When we look at orders data over a 30 day window, we naively calculate an AOV of 3145.13 dollars. Given that we know these shops are selling sneakers, a relatively affordable item, something seems wrong with our analysis. \n",

    "- Right away, I see a large std compared to the mean, which indicates that a few whaling rows are skewing the average order value. To address this, removing the outliers could be used to give a more realistic view of the data for an average user ordering. Removing outliers won't be a large issue because 98.6 per cent of the data will remain, which gives a strong sample size of the 5,000 entries. 98.6 per cent of the data is below 1,000 dollars in value that means 1.4 per cent of the data is the problem here. From searching through the data, it seems that there are buyers requesting over 2000 pairs of 352 dollar shoes, and buyers purchasing 25000 dollar shoes. This is not indicative of an average order statistically, as well as from personal experience of shopping habits. Evidence is below.\n",
    "\n",
    "B) What metric would you report for this dataset?\n",
    "- A non-parametric method such as median. A median should be used because it is less influenced by outliers, which is the biggest issue with this dataset.\n",

    "C) What is its value?\n",
    "- $284.00, evidence is below\n"
